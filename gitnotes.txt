remote repository transfer with push and pull
to add a remote:
git remote add origin url                   (origin is customary??)
use git remote -v to see verbose pull & push url’s
to push use git push origin master

merging - can merge 2 branches
get merge branch1 branch2
after merging commits sorted by date/time so commits from different branches may be interleaved
so... git diff may show a lot of changes since 2 sequential commits may have been interleaved from 2 different branches!!
git show id - shows diff between id and parent when you may not know what the parent was
can delete a branch with
git branch -d branchName
does not delete the commits, only the branch label
commits may or may not be reachable depending on whether a merge was done
merge conflicts

branching:
tip - current last commit on a branch
git log --graph -- oneline master easy_mode
git reset -- hard   removes changes from working directory and staging area  (BE CAREFUL - cannot undo this since not committed)
git add to add to “staging” area
working directory
staging area
repository
can use git init to create repository in current folder
installed git from:  http://msysgit.github.io/
compare files in commits with get diff
git diff originalArg, newArg
git diff with no args compares working directory and staging area
git diff --staged compares contents of staging area with repository
clone with git clone https://...
use git log to see history
use git log --stat to see stats in log history
use git config --global color.ui auto to colorize changes in diff command
git config --global core.editor "c:/notepad++/notepad++.exe” -w     // notice how -w is outside, else notepad++ wants to create a -w file!!!
bug with -w this seemed to fix:
git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe'  -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
use git checkout commitId to get older version
creates a detached head state warning since we are not at the “head” of the repository
